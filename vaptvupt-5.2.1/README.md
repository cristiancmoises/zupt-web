# VaptVupt

Backup compression with hardware-adaptive codec selection, AES-256
authenticated encryption, post-quantum key encapsulation, and full-disk
backup. Pure C11, ~13,000 lines. Builds and runs on x86_64, aarch64,
armhf, ppc64le, s390x, and riscv64.

License: AGPL-3.0-or-later (dual-licensed AGPL + commercial).

> **Renamed from "Zupt" in v3.0.0** because of a prior INPI Brasil
> trademark registration on the name "Zupt" for unrelated software.
> The `.zupt` archive extension and `ZUPT` header magic bytes are
> unchanged — v2.x and v3.0.0 archives remain compatible. The `zupt`
> command is preserved as a symlink to `vaptvupt` for one major version
> cycle.

## What's new in 5.2.1

- **GUI Verify (and Extract) made robust.** Verifying an encrypted archive used
  to make you pick the right PQ mode from a dropdown and remember the private
  key; a wrong pick or a forgotten credential produced a raw decrypt-error dump,
  and verify ran on the GUI thread (freezing the window on a big archive). Now
  the tab **reads the archive header** and auto-detects password / hybrid /
  full-PQ, uses the matching flag automatically (no mode picker to get wrong),
  and if the needed credential is missing it says exactly what to provide
  instead of erroring. Verify now runs in the background like compress/extract.
- **Refreshed comparison + audit tables** in this README, measured on the
  shipped codec (2.65.3): `make check` 16/16, ML-KEM-768 FIPS 203 conformance
  3/3, and the full security regression matrix (see below).

Binaries for the CLI (5.2.1) and GUI (5.2.1) are on the
[release page](https://git.securityops.co/cristiancmoises/vaptvupt/releases/tag/v5.2.1).

---

## What's new in 5.2.0

- **GUI compress crash fixed.** The 5.1.0 progress bar introduced a cross-thread
  bug that could crash the app, hang it, or leave a corrupt archive when
  compressing (worst on the full post-quantum path). Worker callbacks now run on
  the GUI thread via a `_Job` controller; verified on a real X display with zero
  cross-thread widget access and byte-exact round-trips across hybrid, full-PQ,
  and password modes plus Verify/Info/Disk/concurrent/close-mid-job.
- **Codec VaptVupt 2.65.3** — byte-identical output to 2.65.0 (same ratios) but
  ~1.6–2× faster extreme-mode encode and lower peak virtual memory.
- **libvuptsdk** (renamed from `libzuptsdk`) is now the SDK library a
  `WITH_SDK=1` build links for `--pq-sdk` + the Argon2id password KDF; `--pq-box`
  moved to its own `WITH_PQBOX=1` flag (separate `libpqvaptvupt`). The default
  distributed build stays source-only (native `--pq`/`--pq-only` + PBKDF2, no
  external libraries).

Binaries for the CLI (5.2.0) and GUI (5.2.0) are on the
[release page](https://git.securityops.co/cristiancmoises/vaptvupt/releases/tag/v5.2.0).

## What's new in 5.1.0

- **Codec upgraded to VaptVupt 2.65.0** (from 2.60.4). Same on-disk format
  (`.zupt` v1.6, fully interoperable both directions — a 5.0.0 binary reads
  5.1.0 archives and vice-versa), a much faster balanced encoder, and the
  extreme-mode literal-pricing work from codec Sprints 124–130.
- **Big compression-ratio gains — two long-standing settings were leaving most
  of the codec's ratio on the table.** The `.zupt` wrapper (1) *forced* the
  binary-oriented `format_v2` path on every input, which halved the optimal
  parser's ratio on text, and (2) capped the extreme block at 512 KiB, so the
  "large-window extreme" parser could never see past it. Both are fixed:
  `format_v2` is now auto-detected (binary gets it, text keeps the optimal
  parser) and block size scales with level. Measured, level 9 (extreme):

  | Data class | 5.0.0 | 5.1.0 |
  |---|--:|--:|
  | Text (docs/markdown) | 3.77× | **5.98×** |
  | Server logs | 7.21× | **9.07×** |
  | JSON | 8.25× | **9.38×** |
  | Source code | 4.93× | **5.63×** |

  Extreme mode trades encode speed for this (its optimal DP now runs over a
  larger window); balanced (the default, `-l 7`) also improves and stays fast.
  `--dedup` automatically keeps a small block so block-level dedup still works.
  See the [full comparison tables](#compression-comparison) below.
- **GUI: fixed "the app closes / gets stuck when I compress."** Three separate
  defects: the worker thread was garbage-collected while still running (crash on
  every job completion); on Wayland the window never mapped (now falls back to
  XWayland automatically); and the CLI's live progress (`\r` frames) was never
  parsed, so the GUI looked frozen on any file larger than one block — it now
  drives the progress bar. Added `vaptvupt-gui --selftest` for headless launch
  verification.
- No key/format change: `--pq` / `--pq-only` keys and archives from 5.0.0 keep
  working. (The 5.0.0 FIPS 203 KEM change below is unchanged.)

## What's new in 5.0.0

- **Genuine FIPS 203 ML-KEM-768 — validated against OpenSSL.** Earlier releases
  shipped round-3 CRYSTALS-Kyber under a "FIPS 203" label; it was secure but
  **not interoperable** with a compliant ML-KEM. Three deviations (a transposed
  matrix-`Â` sampling convention, the round-3 KDF, and the implicit-rejection
  domain) are fixed, and the result is now **byte-for-byte interoperable with
  OpenSSL 3.5's FIPS 203 ML-KEM-768** in both directions — checked on every
  `make check` (`tests/test_mlkem_fips203.sh`). Hybrid `--pq` (ML-KEM-768 +
  X25519) remains the recommended flagship; `--pq-only` is pure ML-KEM-768.
- **⚠ Breaking:** because the KEM math changed, `--pq`/`--pq-only` **keys and
  archives from ≤ 4.2.1 no longer decrypt** — regenerate keys and re-encrypt.
  Password mode (`-p`) and plain compression are unaffected; wire format is still v1.6.
- **CLI security fixes.** A `compress -p out.zupt file1 file2` **data-loss** bug
  (the archive name was eaten as the password and overwrote `file1`) and a
  `compress out.zupt dir -p pw` **silent-plaintext** bug are both guarded now; a
  **heap OOB read** in the AVX2 decoder on crafted archives is bounded; banners
  report the build's real KDF.
- **GUI reworked so it actually works.** It used to default every encryption
  path to SDK modes absent from the source-only build (key generation failed out
  of the box). Now a build-aware Hybrid/Full-PQ selector, PQ-key auto-detect on
  Extract/Verify, and About/threading fixes.
- **Cross-platform.** A portable GUI package (Windows/macOS/Linux/BSD, needs
  Python + PySide6) and a CI workflow that builds native Windows `.exe`/installer
  and macOS `.dmg` on real runners.

> **F-16 (data loss):** archives created by **≤ 3.8.0** at `-l 8`/`-l 9`
> whose inputs included x86/ELF/PE executables may be **undecodable by any
> version** (write-time defect in the old in-tree BCJ encoder). Re-create
> such archives with 5.0.0 and verify extraction before deleting source
> data. Details in [CHANGELOG.md](CHANGELOG.md).

<a name="compression-comparison"></a>
## Compression comparison

Measured on codec **2.65.3**, one 20–25 MB file per data class, single-thread, best-of-run on an x86-64 AVX2 machine. Ratio = original ÷ compressed (higher is better); every round-trip verified byte-exact. Reproduce with `vaptvupt -b <file>` and the standard `zstd` / `gzip` / `lz4` CLIs. Numbers vary with data and hardware.

### Ratio vs other compressors

VaptVupt at level 9 (extreme) and level 7 (balanced — the default), against zstd, gzip and lz4.

| Data class | VaptVupt -9 | VaptVupt -7 | zstd -9 | zstd -3 | gzip -9 | lz4 -9 |
|---|--:|--:|--:|--:|--:|--:|
| Text (docs, Markdown) | **5.99×** | 4.07× | 6.18× | 4.95× | 3.74× | 3.28× |
| Source code (C / headers) | **5.54×** | 4.88× | 5.75× | 4.93× | 4.97× | 4.14× |
| JSON (structured records) | **8.25×** | 5.88× | 7.41× | 6.60× | 6.67× | 4.51× |
| Server logs | **9.07×** | 6.64× | 8.15× | 6.94× | 7.25× | 5.19× |
| Binaries (.so / ELF) | **1.00×** | 1.00× | 1.01× | 1.00× | 1.01× | 1.00× |
| Incompressible (random) | **1.00×** | 1.00× | 1.00× | 1.00× | 1.00× | 1.00× |

VaptVupt-9 **wins outright on logs and JSON**, and is within a few percent of `zstd -9` on text/source. `zstd` compresses faster; VaptVupt decompresses 2–4× faster than it compresses. Extreme (`-9`) spends CPU for the smallest archive — use the default `-7` for everyday backups.

### Throughput (MB/s, single thread)

The CLI multi-threads compression with `-t 0` (auto); decompression is single-thread and level-independent.

| Data class | -7 comp | -7 decomp | -9 comp | -9 decomp | zstd-9 comp | gzip-9 comp |
|---|--:|--:|--:|--:|--:|--:|
| Text (docs, Markdown) | 130 | 263 | 5 | 305 | 84 | 21 |
| Source code (C / headers) | 149 | 238 | 3 | 291 | 76 | 19 |
| JSON (structured records) | 145 | 226 | 3 | 262 | 62 | 14 |
| Server logs | 198 | 260 | 3 | 266 | 94 | 15 |

### Audit status (5.2.1, source-only build)

Every release runs the security regression matrix (`make check`, ~2 min on x86-64 / aarch64) plus the NIST/RFC known-answer vectors. Results for this release:

| Check | Result |
|---|--:|
| NIST/RFC known-answer vectors (FIPS 180-4/197/202/203, SP 800-38A, RFC 4231/7748/8018) | 16 / 16 |
| ML-KEM-768 FIPS 203 conformance vs OpenSSL 3.5 (both cross-decapsulation directions) | 3 / 3 |
| Path-traversal extraction guards | 5 / 5 |
| Block-swap / reorder tamper detection | 6 / 6 |
| Dedup fresh-nonce (no AES-CTR keystream reuse) | 1 / 1 |
| Argument-order data-loss / plaintext guards | 8 / 8 |
| AVX2 decode over-copy (out-of-bounds) guard | 7 / 7 |
| SHA-NI hardware path + incremental HMAC | 9 / 9 |
| Exact-size decode (no over-read / over-write) | 80 / 80 |
| GUI branding + license consistency | 11 / 11 |
| Help / static-analysis consistency | 16 / 16 |

Constant-time MAC/KEM timing is measured with dudect where the environment allows (inconclusive under a shared VM). See [AUDIT.md](AUDIT.md) and [SECURITY.md](SECURITY.md) for the full verification matrix and threat model.

## Features

- **Hardware-adaptive codec** — auto-detects AVX2/NEON at runtime and
  selects the codec: VaptVupt (LZ77 + tANS + SIMD decode) on capable
  hardware, VaptVupt-LZHP on everything else. Override with `--vv` or
  `--lzhp`.
- **Post-quantum encryption** — `--pq` uses ML-KEM-768 + X25519 hybrid
  KEM (the approach used by Signal and iMessage), protecting against
  "harvest now, decrypt later" attacks. `--pq-only` offers a full (pure)
  ML-KEM-768 mode with no classical component for "PQ-only" compliance
  postures. Both are in-tree and available in the default build; hybrid
  `--pq` is the recommended default.
- **AES-NI acceleration** — AES-256-CTR via Jasmin-verified assembly with
  a 4-block interleaved pipeline. AVX detection validates OSXSAVE/XCR0 (no
  SIGILL). Falls back to C table-based AES on unsupported hardware.
- **SHA-NI acceleration** — HMAC-SHA256 (the Encrypt-then-MAC pass) and
  PBKDF2 use the Intel SHA-NI compression path when the CPU supports it
  (Intel Goldmont+/Ice Lake+, AMD Zen+), selected at runtime via CPUID.
  Bit-identical output; scalar C fallback elsewhere. `vaptvupt version`
  prints the acceleration set for your CPU.
- **Incremental HMAC** — the per-block MAC streams its segments through an
  incremental HMAC-SHA256 instead of copying each block's ciphertext into
  a temporary buffer, removing a per-block heap allocation and full-payload
  copy on encrypt and decrypt with a byte-for-byte identical MAC (RFC 2104).
- **Multi-threaded** — compression and decompression both parallelized.
  `-t 0` auto-detects cores.
- **Full-disk backup** — `vaptvupt disk backup` clones disks or partitions
  in one command. Sparse block detection skips zero regions; all encryption
  modes supported; restore verifies per-block XXH64 checksums.
- **Per-block integrity** — XXH64 checksum + HMAC-SHA256 per block. Wrong
  password rejected immediately.
- **Self-describing KDF** — password archives record their key-derivation
  profile in the authenticated header, so an archive carries the parameters
  needed to open it later. Unknown profiles are refused fail-closed rather
  than mis-derived. Default is PBKDF2-SHA256 (600K iterations); Argon2id is
  available in a `WITH_SDK=1` build.
- **Constant-time comparisons** — every security-critical comparison (HMAC
  tag, archive-integrity trailer, ML-KEM-768 implicit-rejection check)
  routes through a single primitive (`zupt_ct_memeq`, branch-free, volatile
  accumulator, length-independent), checked by a dudect-style Welch t-test
  in CI.
- **Formally verified crypto** — 5 Jasmin assembly functions with
  constant-time proofs; 19 ACSL-annotated functions for Frama-C memory
  safety analysis.
- **Multi-architecture** — builds on x86_64, aarch64, armhf, ppc64le,
  s390x, riscv64. Jasmin CT crypto on x86_64, C fallback everywhere else.
  Any archive decompresses on any architecture.
- **No external dependencies (default build)** — ML-KEM, X25519, Keccak,
  SHA-256, AES-256, HMAC, PBKDF2 and the VaptVupt codec are all pure C11.
  Builds with `gcc` or `cl` alone.

## Quick Start

### Build & install
```
git clone https://git.securityops.co/cristiancmoises/vaptvupt.git && \
cd vaptvupt && \
make && \
sudo make install
```

The default build needs only a C compiler and `make` (plus libm/pthread).
`make WITH_SDK=1` additionally links the separately distributed
`libzuptsdk`/`libpqvaptvupt` to enable `--pq-sdk`, `--pq-box`, and the
Argon2id KDF.

### Building from SRPM (Fedora / RHEL / RPM-based distributions)

```bash
tar xzf vaptvupt-5.2.1.srpm.tar.gz
cd ~/rpmbuild  # or use rpmbuild --define "_topdir $(pwd)"
rpmbuild -bb SPECS/vaptvupt.spec
sudo rpm -i RPMS/x86_64/vaptvupt-5.2.1-1.*.rpm
```

### Basic usage

```bash
# Compress a directory (auto-selects codec for your hardware)
vaptvupt compress backup.zupt ~/Documents/

# Compress at a specific level (1=fast, 5=balanced, 9=extreme)
vaptvupt compress -l 9 backup.zupt ~/Documents/

# Force the VaptVupt codec (default on AVX2/NEON hardware)
vaptvupt compress --vv -l 5 backup.zupt ~/Documents/

# Multi-threading (-t 0 = auto-detect cores)
vaptvupt compress -t 0 -l 5 backup.zupt ~/Documents/

# Password encryption (AES-256-CTR + HMAC-SHA256, PBKDF2-SHA256 KDF)
vaptvupt compress -p "my-strong-password" backup.zupt ~/Documents/

# List archive contents
vaptvupt list backup.zupt

# Show archive metadata (no password needed)
vaptvupt info backup.zupt

# Verify archive integrity (HMAC + per-block checksums)
vaptvupt test backup.zupt
vaptvupt test -p "my-strong-password" backup.zupt

# Extract
vaptvupt extract -o ~/restored/ backup.zupt
vaptvupt extract -p "my-strong-password" -o ~/restored/ backup.zupt

# Benchmark all 9 levels on a file
vaptvupt bench big-file.tar
```

#### Post-quantum encryption

```bash
# Native --pq (ML-KEM-768 + X25519 hybrid KEM, in-tree, default build).
# Recommended for new archives.
vaptvupt keygen -o mykey.key
vaptvupt keygen --pub -o pub.key -k mykey.key
vaptvupt compress --pq pub.key backup.zupt ~/Documents/
vaptvupt extract  --pq mykey.key -o ~/restored/ backup.zupt

# Native --pq-only (full/pure ML-KEM-768, no classical component).
# Use only for "PQ-only" compliance postures; --pq (hybrid) is safer.
vaptvupt keygen --pq-only -o pqkey
vaptvupt keygen --pub --pq-only -o pqkey.pub -k pqkey
vaptvupt compress --pq-only pqkey.pub backup.zupt ~/Documents/
vaptvupt extract  --pq-only pqkey -o ~/restored/ backup.zupt
```

The SDK-backed modes below require a `make WITH_SDK=1` build linked against
the separately distributed `libzuptsdk`/`libpqvaptvupt`:

```bash
# --pq-sdk (HKDF combiner + key commitment + HPKE binding + Argon2id)
vaptvupt keygen --sdk -o mykey.priv     # writes mykey.priv and mykey.priv.pub
vaptvupt compress --pq-sdk mykey.priv.pub backup.zupt ~/Documents/
vaptvupt extract  --pq-sdk mykey.priv -o ~/restored/ backup.zupt

# --pq-box sealed-box (ML-KEM-768 + X25519 via HKDF-SHA256 combiner)
vaptvupt keygen --box -o box.key                       # writes box.key + box.key.pub
vaptvupt compress --pq-box box.key.pub backup.zupt ~/Documents/
vaptvupt extract  --pq-box box.key -o ~/restored/ backup.zupt
```

#### Full-disk backup

```bash
# Backup a disk or partition (sparse-detection skips zero regions)
sudo vaptvupt disk backup -l 5 disk.zupt /dev/sda

# With encryption
sudo vaptvupt disk backup -p "passphrase" -l 5 disk.zupt /dev/sda

# Restore (writes raw bytes back to a block device or file)
sudo vaptvupt disk restore disk.zupt /dev/sdb
sudo vaptvupt disk restore -p "passphrase" disk.zupt /dev/sdb

# Backup a partition image file (no root needed)
vaptvupt disk backup -l 5 part.zupt /path/to/partition.img
```

## Auto Codec Detection

VaptVupt selects the compression codec based on your hardware (since
v2.0.0). No flags needed — `vaptvupt compress` picks the fastest option
available.

| Architecture | SIMD Available | Default Codec | Decode Throughput |
|---|---|---|---|
| x86_64 + AVX2 | AVX2 inline SIMD | VaptVupt | ~2–3 GB/s |
| x86_64 (no AVX2) | Scalar | VaptVupt-LZHP | ~500 MB/s |
| aarch64 + NEON | NEON SIMD | VaptVupt | ~1–2 GB/s |
| armhf, ppc64le, s390x, riscv64 | Scalar | VaptVupt-LZHP | ~300–500 MB/s |

Decompression is universal. An archive created with VaptVupt on x86_64
extracts on aarch64 (NEON or scalar decode) and vice versa. The codec ID
is stored per-block; the decoder dispatches to the right path
automatically. Override with `--vv` or `--lzhp`.

## VaptVupt Codec

VaptVupt combines LZ77 dictionary matching with tANS (table-based
Asymmetric Numeral Systems) entropy coding and SIMD-accelerated
decompression.

This release embeds VaptVupt codec 2.65.3 (from the
[vaptvupt-codec](https://git.securityops.co/cristiancmoises/vaptvupt-codec)
repository, tag v2.65.0). Over the previous 2.60.4 it adds a faster balanced
encoder and the Sprint 124–130 extreme-mode literal-pricing improvements. Two
in-tree audit patches ride on top of the vendored source (an ANS decode
safe-zone reserve and an AVX2 offset-read bound). See [CHANGELOG.md](CHANGELOG.md).

### Architecture

```
Encoder: Hash-chain LZ77 → 5-byte multiply-shift hash, rep-match (3 recent offsets),
         lazy-2 parsing, AVX2 match extension (32 bytes/cycle), cost-aware lazy parser
Entropy: Canonical Huffman | tANS | 4-way interleaved ANS | order-1 context model
         4-stream Huffman literal coding (lit_fmt=4) for structured data
Decoder: AVX2 inline SIMD copies, tiered by offset (32/16/8/overlap), safe-zone fast path
         NEON SIMD on aarch64, scalar fallback on all architectures
Format:  v1 frame (default) and v2 frame (T-tag, min_match=3) for binary data
```

### Modes

| Mode | CLI | Chain Depth | Entropy | Use Case |
|------|-----|-------------|---------|----------|
| Ultra-Fast | `-l 1` to `-l 2` | 4 | None | Speed priority, streaming |
| Balanced | `-l 3` to `-l 7` (default) | 48 | 4-way ANS | General backup data |
| Extreme | `-l 8` to `-l 9` | 256 | Order-1 context ANS + cost-aware lazy parser | Maximum compression |

The wrapper leaves the codec's `format_v2` flag on **auto**: since codec
v2.61.0 the encoder enables the `T`-tag / min_match=3 path for binary-detected
input on its own and keeps the optimal `S` parser for text. (Forcing it, as
5.0.0 did, routed text through the binary path and roughly halved the
extreme-mode text ratio.) Block size scales with level so the extreme parser
gets a real window (see [`auto_block_size`](src/zupt_format.c)); `--dedup`
overrides that with a small block so block-level deduplication still finds
duplicates.

### Measured benchmark

Head-to-head ratio and throughput against zstd / gzip / lz4 are in the
[Compression comparison](#compression-comparison) section above (codec 2.65.0,
this release). Reproduce any cell with `vaptvupt -b <file>`.

Reading those numbers:

- On ratio VaptVupt-9 **wins outright on logs and JSON** and is within a few
  percent of `zstd -19`-class output on text and source. `zstd` still
  *compresses* faster; VaptVupt *decodes* 2–4× faster than it compresses.
- Encode throughput is the tradeoff. The optimal parser and hash-chain walk
  that win ratio cost encode speed; extreme (`-l 8`/`-l 9`) is the
  "spend CPU for the smallest archive" setting. For everyday backups use the
  default balanced `-l 7` (fast and still a strong ratio); for
  encode-latency-bound workloads use `-l 1`/`-l 2`.
- On random / already-compressed data, all codecs hit the
  incompressibility wall.

### Security regression tests

Every release re-runs the security regression matrix (`make check`,
≈2 minutes on x86_64 and aarch64). It covers:

- HMAC single-bit tamper detection and honest roundtrips.
- Archive-integrity trailer (header/footer tamper detection).
- Byte-level integrity sweep on a PQ archive (every byte flipped).
- KDF default (PBKDF2-SHA256) and self-describing header transparency,
  with back-compat and fail-closed on unknown profiles.
- Indistinguishable wrong-password vs tampered-archive error messages.
- Encrypted comment block bound to per-block AAD.
- Constant-time comparison (dudect Welch t-test on MAC tag and ML-KEM
  decaps) plus a source-routing guard.
- Codec exact-`content_size` decode cases (incl. BCJ payloads) under ASan.
- NIST/RFC test vectors: SHA-256, SHA-3, SHAKE-128, ML-KEM-768,
  AES-256-CTR (SP 800-38A), HMAC-SHA256, X25519, XXH64.
- Path-traversal refusal, block-swap detection, deduplication correctness,
  and CLI argument-order invariance.

`make test` runs the full suite including dist reproducibility and
packaging-syntax checks.

### Codec notes

- **tANS entropy** — asymptotically optimal coding with single-instruction
  decode per symbol (vs Huffman's multi-step tree walk).
- **4-way interleaved ANS** — decodes 4 symbols per bitstream refill cycle.
- **4-stream Huffman literal coding** (`lit_fmt=4`) — improves ratio on
  structured data.
- **AVX2/NEON SIMD decode** — inline 32-byte copies with tiered offset
  handling. Scalar fallback on unsupported hardware.
- **Rep-match** — checks 3 recent offsets before the hash probe (O(1) vs
  O(chain_depth)), hitting ~30% of matches.
- **Order-1 context model** — captures byte-pair correlations in structured
  data (JSON, CSV, logs).
- **Cost-aware lazy parser** — puts Extreme mode ahead of zstd-3 in
  aggregate ratio.
- **Adaptive window** — trial-compresses at wlog=16 vs wlog=20, picking the
  larger window only if ≥3% improvement.
- **`format_v2`** (T-tag, min_match=3) — 4–7% better binary ratio;
  transparent to v2.33.0+ decoders.
- **Memory hygiene** — encoder working buffers scrubbed via
  `vv_secure_zero` before `free()`.
- **~6,500 lines** of pure C11.

## Post-Quantum Encryption

VaptVupt has two native PQ modes, both in-tree and available in the default
build.

**`--pq` — hybrid ML-KEM-768 + X25519 (envelope `0x02`, recommended):**

```
Public key → ML-KEM-768 Encaps + X25519 ECDH → hybrid shared secret
           → SHA3-512(ss ‖ transcript) → enc_key[32] + mac_key[32]
           → AES-256-CTR + HMAC-SHA256 per block
```

Security model: secure if **EITHER** ML-KEM-768 (post-quantum) **OR** X25519
(classical) is secure. This is the recommended default — it stays safe even
if one primitive is later broken.

**`--pq-only` — full/pure ML-KEM-768 (envelope `0x06`):**

```
Public key → ML-KEM-768 Encaps → shared secret ss, ciphertext ct
           → archive_key = SHA3-512(ss ‖ ct ‖ "ZUPT-PQ-ONLY-v1")
           → AES-256-CTR + HMAC-SHA256 per block
```

Security model: secure if ML-KEM-768 is secure — there is **no classical
fallback**. Choose this only when a policy mandates a single NIST-standardised
PQ primitive with no classical KEM in the envelope (CNSA 2.0-style "PQ-only").
The trade-off is explicit: a future break of ML-KEM-768 *alone* breaks the
archive, whereas under `--pq` the attacker must also break X25519. **When in
doubt, use `--pq`.**

Password mode (`-p`) is not quantum-safe. Use `--pq` (or `--pq-only`) for
long-term protection.

The SDK-backed `--pq-sdk` and `--pq-box` modes are optional and require a
`make WITH_SDK=1` build against `libzuptsdk`/`libpqvaptvupt`.

## Full-Disk Backup

Clone disks, partitions, or raw images with compression and encryption in
one command.

### Quick start
```bash
# Clone a partition (requires read access)
sudo vaptvupt disk backup backup.zupt /dev/sda1

# Clone with post-quantum encryption
vaptvupt keygen -o mykey.key
vaptvupt keygen --pub -o pub.key -k mykey.key
sudo vaptvupt disk backup --pq pub.key backup.zupt /dev/nvme0n1p2

# Clone with password encryption
sudo vaptvupt disk backup -p backup.zupt /dev/sda1

# Maximum compression (level 9, extreme mode)
sudo vaptvupt disk backup -l 9 backup.zupt /dev/sda1

# Restore to a device or file
sudo vaptvupt disk restore backup.zupt /dev/sda1
sudo vaptvupt disk restore --pq mykey.key backup.zupt /dev/sda1
```

### How it works

```
Source device → Read 4MB blocks → Sparse detection → Compress → Encrypt → Write .zupt
                                      │                 │          │
                                      │                 │          └─ AES-256-CTR + HMAC-SHA256
                                      │                 └─ VaptVupt/LZHP (auto-selected)
                                      └─ Zero blocks stored as STORE (near-zero overhead)
```

VaptVupt reads the source device sequentially in 4MB chunks. Each block is
checked for all-zero content (8-byte-wide comparison). Zero blocks are
stored with codec `STORE` — effectively just the block header with no
payload. Non-zero blocks are compressed with the selected codec and
optionally encrypted. Per-block XXH64 checksums ensure byte-for-byte
integrity on restore.

### Best practices

Encryption modes:

| Mode | Command | Security Level | Speed Impact |
|------|---------|---------------|-------------|
| PQ Hybrid | `--pq pub.key` | Quantum-resistant + classical | ~5% overhead |
| Password | `-p` | AES-256, PBKDF2-SHA256 600K iter | ~3% overhead |
| None | (default) | Integrity only (XXH64) | Fastest |

Compression levels for disks:

| Level | Mode | Best for | Typical ratio |
|-------|------|----------|--------------|
| `-l 1` to `-l 3` | Ultra-Fast | Live systems, NVMe (speed priority) | 1.5–2.5:1 |
| `-l 4` to `-l 7` | Balanced (default) | General partitions, ext4/NTFS | 2–5:1 |
| `-l 8` to `-l 9` | Extreme | Cold storage, archival backups | 3–10:1 |

Operational guidance:

- Unmount before backup for filesystem consistency. For live systems use
  LVM snapshots or filesystem freeze:
  `fsfreeze -f /mnt/data && vaptvupt disk backup ... && fsfreeze -u /mnt/data`.
- Block devices require root on Linux. Regular files (disk images, `.img`,
  `.raw`) do not.
- Sparse-heavy disks compress well — the sparse detector skips zero blocks
  at memory-copy speed with no compression overhead.
- Verify after backup with `vaptvupt test archive.zupt` — checks every
  block's XXH64 checksum without extracting.
- For long-term disk backups use `--pq`. Generate one keypair, store the
  private key offline, distribute the public key.
- Restore is non-destructive on files (creates/overwrites the file);
  writing to a block device overwrites the raw device. Double-check the
  target path before restoring to a device.

## Security

```
Password mode:  Password → PBKDF2-SHA256 (600K iter) → enc_key + mac_key
PQ hybrid mode: Public key → ML-KEM-768 Encaps + X25519 ECDH → enc_key + mac_key
Per-block:      AES-256-CTR(enc_key, nonce ⊕ seq) + HMAC-SHA256(mac_key)
Key protection: mlock() prevents swap, buffer canaries detect overflow
Timing:         Always-decrypt mitigation (no timing oracle on MAC failure)
AES dispatch:   AVX+AES-NI check with OSXSAVE/XCR0 (no SIGILL on any CPU)
Path safety:    Zip Slip / symlink defenses (zupt_path_is_safe + O_NOFOLLOW)
Verification:   5 Jasmin CT proofs, 19 ACSL contracts, 16 NIST/RFC test vectors
```

The `WITH_SDK=1` build adds an HKDF-SHA3 combiner with domain separation,
key commitment, and HPKE binding for the `--pq-sdk`/`--pq-box` modes, plus
the Argon2id KDF.

Internal audit passes on the 2.2.x line fixed 14 bugs, including a
HIGH-severity Zip Slip path traversal. There has been no external audit.

Wire format v1.6, interoperable with 5.0.x/5.1.0 |
| v5.2.1 | GUI Verify/Extract now auto-detect the archive's encryption from its header, use the matching decrypt flag automatically, and guide you when a password/key is missing instead of dumping a raw error; Verify runs in the background. Refreshed comparison + audit tables. GUI + docs only; no format/codec change |
