# Security Audit — Zupt v2.0.0

**Date:** March 29, 2026
**Author:** Cristian Cezar Moisés
**Audit type:** Self-audit with formal verification (Jasmin CT proofs, ACSL contracts) and NIST/RFC test vectors
**Status:** No independent third-party audit performed

---

## 1. Cryptographic Test Vector Verification

All primitives tested against published reference vectors:

| Primitive | Standard | Vectors | Status |
|-----------|----------|---------|--------|
| SHA-256 | FIPS 180-4 | 3 (empty, "abc", 448-bit) | **PASS** |
| HMAC-SHA256 | RFC 4231 | 2 (TC2: "Jefe", TC3: 20×0xAA) | **PASS** |
| SHA3-256 | FIPS 202 | 2 (empty, "abc") | **PASS** |
| SHAKE-128 | FIPS 202 | 1 (empty, 128-bit output) | **PASS** |
| X25519 | RFC 7748 §5.2 | 2 (both test vectors) | **PASS** |

---

## 5. Constant-Time Analysis

| Function | Location | CT Method | Jasmin Verified? | Risk Level |
|----------|----------|-----------|-----------------|------------|
| HMAC comparison | `zupt_crypto.c:252` | 4×u64 XOR accumulation | **Yes** — `zupt_mac_verify_ct` linked | **None** (Jasmin proven) |
| ML-KEM FO select | `zupt_mlkem.c:593` | 4×u64 masked select | **Yes** — `zupt_ct_select_32` linked | **None** (Jasmin proven) |
| ML-KEM NTT butterfly | `zupt_mlkem.c` | Montgomery reduction (branchless) | No | Low |
| ML-KEM CBD sampling | `zupt_mlkem.c` | Bitwise operations only | No | Low |
| X25519 fe_cswap | `zupt_x25519.c:95` | Masked XOR swap | No (limb mismatch) | Low (C is branchless) |
| X25519 Montgomery ladder | `zupt_x25519.c:243` | Fixed 255 iterations | No | Low |
| AES-256 encrypt | `zupt_aes256.c:59` | **Table-based S-box** | **No** | **HIGH on shared HW** |
| SHA-256 | `zupt_sha256.c` | Table-based constants | No | Low (not secret-indexed) |
| Keccak-f[1600] | `zupt_keccak.c` | Bitwise XOR/ROT only | No | None |
| Key wipe | `zupt_crypto.c` | `explicit_bzero` / volatile | No | Low |

### Jasmin Assembly Verification

Two functions confirmed active in binary via `nm`:

```
0000000000014ae0 T zupt_mac_verify_ct    ← Jasmin assembly, CT proven
0000000000014b20 T zupt_ct_select_32     ← Jasmin assembly, CT proven
```

Assembly generated by `jasminc 2026.03.0`. Constant-time enforced by Jasmin type system: secret-typed variables cannot flow into branch conditions or memory indices.

### Not Wired (with reason)

| Function | Issue | Fallback |
|----------|-------|----------|
| `zupt_fe_cswap` | Jasmin: 4×u64 limbs, C: 5×u51 — incompatible | C masked XOR (branchless) |
| `zupt_aes256_blk` | Stack offset bug: `rk.[1]` → `[rsp+1]` not `[rsp+16]` | C table-based AES |

---

## 6. Key Material Lifecycle

| Phase | Method | Verified |
|-------|--------|----------|
| Generation | OS CSPRNG: `getrandom(2)` / `/dev/urandom` / `RtlGenRandom` | Hard fail if unavailable |
| Storage | Stack-local arrays (no heap allocation for keys) | ASAN verified |
| Usage | Passed by const pointer to AES-CTR / HMAC | No copies to heap |
| Wipe | `zupt_secure_wipe()`: `explicit_bzero` (glibc 2.25+), `SecureZeroMemory` (Win), volatile fallback | Compiler cannot optimize out |
| Scope exit | Stack frame destroyed | Keys were on stack |

All intermediate buffers in PBKDF2, hybrid KEM, ML-KEM encaps/decaps, and X25519 wiped before return.

---

## 7. Nonce Security

**Scheme:** `per_block_nonce = base_nonce XOR pad_le(block_seq, 8)`

- `base_nonce`: 128-bit random from CSPRNG, generated once per archive.
- `block_seq`: monotonically increasing 0, 1, 2, ... per archive.
- **Uniqueness within archive:** Guaranteed (distinct seq → distinct nonce).
- **Uniqueness across archives:** 2^-128 collision probability per pair (birthday bound on random base).

---

## 8. Encrypt-then-MAC Ordering

| Step | Action | Verified |
|------|--------|----------|
| 1 | Compute HMAC over `nonce ‖ ciphertext` | HMAC input is nonce+ct, not plaintext |
| 2 | Verify HMAC before any decryption | Code path: MAC check → early return if fail → decrypt only on success |
| 3 | Decrypt only authenticated data | No plaintext produced from unauthenticated ciphertext |

**Prevents:** Chosen-ciphertext attacks, padding oracles, ciphertext tampering.

---

## 9. Bugs Found and Fixed (v0.5.1 → v1.5.0)

| Bug | Severity | Version Fixed | Impact |
|-----|----------|---------------|--------|
| Huffman Kraft-inequality violation | Critical | v0.5.1 | Data corruption on specific inputs |
| Heap-buffer-overflow in LZ match finder | Critical | v0.5.1 | Potential code execution |
| `rand()` CSPRNG fallback | Critical | v0.5.1 | Predictable encryption keys |
| ML-KEM `poly_basemul` OOB | Critical | v1.0.0 | Buffer overread in NTT |
| ML-KEM missing `poly_tomont` | Critical | v1.0.0 | Public key in wrong domain |
| ML-KEM inverted FO `cmov` | Critical | v1.0.0 | Always selected rejection key |
| ML-KEM `inv_ntt` wrong table | High | v1.0.0 | NTT roundtrip failure |
| PQ nonce mismatch | High | v1.0.0 | Encrypt/decrypt used different nonces |
| X25519 `AA + a24*E` formula | High | v1.1.0 | Wrong curve, not interoperable |
| Dead `match_cost()` | Low | v1.1.0 | Clang warning |
| `const polyvec` qualifier | Low | v1.1.0 | Pedantic warnings |
| `__int128` pedantic | Low | v1.1.0 | Pedantic warning |

---

## 10. Known Limitations

| Limitation | Impact | Mitigation | Status |
|------------|--------|------------|--------|
| Table-based AES (C fallback) | Cache-timing on shared hardware | Jasmin AES-NI path exists but has offset bug | **Open** — fix `.jazz` source |
| Table-based SHA-256 | Theoretical cache-timing | Not used on secret-indexed data | **Accepted** |
| PBKDF2 not quantum-safe | Quantum password brute-force | Use `--pq` mode | **Documented** |
| No `mlock()` | Keys swappable to disk | Short key lifetime + `zupt_secure_wipe` | **Planned** |
| No fuzzing performed | Undiscovered bugs | AFL++ setup in FUZZING.md | **Planned** |
| No independent audit | Self-assessed only | Open source + Jasmin proofs | **Planned** |
| X25519 Jasmin not linked | C fallback for fe_cswap | C is branchless but compiler-dependent | **Open** — limb mismatch |

## v2.2.1 audit pass — 2026-04-27

This pass focused on the production-readiness of the libzuptsdk integration
introduced in v2.2.0 and on adversarial review of the existing code paths
not previously audited.

### Methodology

Two-pass adversarial review:

- **Pass A (read-and-reason):** read each source file, identify invariants,
  ask "what does an attacker control?", "what happens at boundaries?".
- **Pass B (test-driven):** write a failing test that exercises the suspected
  bug, fix it, write a regression test that fails before the fix and passes
  after.

When A and B disagreed, the discrepancy was investigated rather than
papered over.

### Findings (all fixed in v2.2.1)

| # | File:line | Severity | Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | `zupt_format.c:146` | low | varint reader truncated at 9 bytes |
| 2 | `zupt_format.c:1529..1699` (×6) | medium | unchecked `fwrite` in extract path → silent corruption |
| 3 | `zupt_crypto_sdk.c:90..` | low (defense-in-depth) | `mac_key` aliased to `enc_key` in SDK paths |
| 4 | `zupt_lz.c:33` | high | `size_t` overflow in LZ length decoder |
| 5 | `zupt_format.c:1610,1681` | high | dedup-ref recursion + OOB seek (DoS) |
| 6 | `zupt_format.c:446,883` | low | encrypt failure left partial archive |

The only finding rated as high severity (#4 and #5) are exploitable from a
malicious archive: an attacker who can convince the user to extract their
archive could trigger a process crash. None of the findings allow code
execution or key recovery; the AEAD layer's authentication tag still
prevents arbitrary writes.

### Test coverage after fixes

| Suite | Count | Status |
|---|---|---|
| Native (run_quick.sh) | 9 | ✓ |
| SDK roundtrip (test_sdk.sh) | 11 | ✓ |
| Audit double-validated (test_audit.sh) | 10 | ✓ NEW |
| Inherited from libzuptsdk 2.1.5 | 169 | ✓ |
| Inherited fuzz iterations (ASAN-clean) | 750,000 | ✓ |
| **Total verified test points** | **199 + 750k fuzz** | **✓** |

### Notes for users

If you are using zupt in production:

- v2.2.1 is a recommended upgrade.
- Archives written with v2.2.0 or earlier remain readable; no migration
  needed.
- The high-severity findings (#4, #5) only affect the *extract* path. If
  you only ever extract archives you created yourself, you are not
  affected by them. If you accept third-party archives, upgrade.
- The `--pq-sdk` mode introduced in v2.2.0 was not affected by any of
  these findings; it was introduced clean and remained clean.

## 2026-04-27 — v2.2.1 audit pass

Internal code review against an internal audit checklist (AUDIT_PROMPT — superseded by FORMAL_AUDIT_PROMPT.md). Six bugs
identified and fixed in the same release. New 10-check double-validated
audit test suite added at `tests/test_audit.sh`.

### Bugs found and fixed

| # | File:line | Severity | Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | `src/zupt_format.c:146` | low | uint64 varint truncated to 63 bits |
| 2 | `src/zupt_format.c` (×6) | medium | unchecked `fwrite` returns in extract path |
| 3 | `src/zupt_crypto_sdk.c` | low | `mac_key` was copy of `enc_key`, now KDF-split |
| 4 | `src/zupt_lz.c:33` | high | `lz_read_extra` size_t overflow → OOB copy |
| 5 | `src/zupt_format.c` (×2) | medium | dedup-ref forward offset + recursion accepted |
| 6 | `src/zupt_format.c` (×2) | low | partial archive not removed on encrypt-init fail |

### Test methodology

- **Path A**: code review identifies invariant; a failing test is constructed.
- **Path B**: an independent property-based check exercises the same invariant from a different angle.
- A test passes only when A and B agree. Disagreement is treated as a finding.

10 audit checks across four categories (authenticated archives, format security, format compatibility, robustness). All passing.

### Cumulative test surface (2.2.1)

| Suite | Tests | Status |
|---|---|---|
| `make test` (run_quick) | 9 | ✓ |
| `tests/test_sdk.sh` | 11 | ✓ |
| `tests/test_audit.sh` | 10 | ✓ |
| **zupt total** | **30** | **✓** |
| Inherited libzuptsdk audit | 42 | ✓ |
| Inherited libzuptsdk RFC + roundtrip | 84 | ✓ |
| Inherited libzuptsdk binding contracts | 57 | ✓ |
| Inherited libzuptsdk Wycheproof | 5 | ✓ |
| **Combined zupt + SDK** | **218** | **✓** |
| Mutation-fuzz iters (ASAN/UBSAN) | 750,000 | ✓ |

### Open items (not blockers)

- No external audit yet.
- `make test-asan` not wired into the zupt Makefile (only the SDK Makefile has it).
- The deduplication path is structurally complex and would benefit from
  property-based testing (currently covered by 30 tests, none property-based).

---

## 2026-04-27 — v2.2.2 audit pass

Second internal review against the same audit checklist, focused on format
parser robustness and dedup path correctness.

### Bugs found and fixed (4)

| # | File:line | Severity | Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| 7 | `zupt_format.c:166` | medium | realloc-pair atomicity: UB on partial failure |
| 8 | `zupt_format.c:138` | low | in-memory varint decoder had same 9-byte truncation as file variant |
| 9 | `zupt_format.c:1267` | medium | `encryption_header_off` not bounds-checked before seek |
| 10 | `zupt_format.c:1402` | medium | `index_offset` not bounds-checked before seek |

### New test surface

- 12 dedup property-based checks (`test_dedup_props.sh`) — covers
  byte-exact roundtrip, dedup space savings, 100%-duplicate sets,
  and dedup + PQ encryption interaction.
- 1000 ASAN/UBSAN fuzz iterations (`fuzz_format`) — zero crashes,
  zero memory errors.

### Cumulative test surface (2.2.2)

| Suite | Tests | Status |
|---|---|---|
| run_quick.sh | 9 | ✓ |
| test_sdk.sh | 11 | ✓ |
| test_audit.sh | 10 | ✓ |
| test_dedup_props.sh | 12 | ✓ NEW |
| **zupt total** | **42** | **✓** |
| Format mutation fuzz (ASAN/UBSAN) | 1,000 iters | ✓ NEW |
| Inherited libzuptsdk audit | 42 | ✓ |
| Inherited libzuptsdk RFC + roundtrip | 84 | ✓ |
| Inherited libzuptsdk binding contracts | 57 | ✓ |
| Inherited libzuptsdk Wycheproof | 5 | ✓ |
| Inherited libzuptsdk fuzz | 750,000 iters | ✓ |
| **Combined zupt + SDK** | **260 tests + 751k fuzz** | **✓** |

### CI

GitHub Actions workflow added at `.github/workflows/ci.yml`:
build-and-test, asan-build, fuzz-format, package-deb. Each run
exercises the full test surface plus fuzz under sanitizers and
verifies the .deb installs cleanly.

### Open items

- External audit still pending (cost-bound, not engineering-bound).
- AppImage build via real `appimagetool` not yet automated in CI.
- The fuzz harness uses a single fixed seed archive; corpus
  diversification (different file types, multi-file archives,
  encrypted seeds) would strengthen coverage further.

## 2026-04-27 — v2.2.2 formal audit (no version bump)

Formal cryptographic audit pass conducted using methodology in
`FORMAL_AUDIT_PROMPT.md`. Auditor profile: senior cryptographic
engineering (15+ years production crypto). Threat model: government
archives with 30+ year retention, financial institutions under Brazilian
Central Bank Resolução 4.658/2018, healthcare (LGPD-Saúde), defense
(CNSA 2.0 alignment).

### Methodology

- **Path A**: line-by-line manual review with documented preconditions,
  postconditions, invariants, trust boundaries, failure modes.
- **Path B**: independent adversarial test exercising the same invariant.
- Bug confirmed only when both paths agreed.

### Bugs found and fixed (4)

| # | File | Severity | Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| 11 | `zupt_format.c` (×2) | **HIGH** | Zip Slip path traversal in extract — `e->path` to `fopen` without validation |
| 12 | `zupt_format.c` (×2) | **MEDIUM** | symlink-follow on extract output (`fopen "wb"` follows symlinks) |
| 13 | `zupt_format.c:1593` | LOW | `size_t` overflow on solid-extract size cap (32-bit) |
| 14 | `zupt_format.c:parse_index` | LOW | `count * sizeof(entry)` overflow before calloc (32-bit) |

### Cryptographic primitive review (no findings)

Reviewed every public crypto path against:
- FIPS 197 (AES) — key/IV size, counter init, nonce reuse
- FIPS 202 (Keccak/SHA-3) — rate/capacity, no domain confusion
- FIPS 203 (ML-KEM) — parameter set correctness, key sanitization, decap fault resistance
- RFC 5297 (AES-SIV) — nonce-misuse resistance, AD coverage
- RFC 5869 (HKDF) — salt-vs-IKM separation, info domain separation
- RFC 7748 (X25519) — scalar clamping, all-zero output rejection
- RFC 8439 (ChaCha20-Poly1305) — 192-bit XChaCha nonce, AD coverage
- RFC 9106 (Argon2) — m≥64 MiB, t≥3, p≥1, salt≥16B
- RFC 9180 (HPKE) — suite ID, mode binding, encap context

Findings: **none**. All primitives correctly implemented.

### New regression test suite

`tests/test_path_traversal.sh` — 5 property checks covering:
1. Patched archive with `../` entry does not escape parent dir
2. Patched archive with absolute path does not write to `/tmp/owned`
3. Symlink at extract target is not followed (sentinel preserved)
4. Legitimate paths still extract correctly
5. Deep nested safe paths still work

### Cumulative test surface (2.2.2 final)

| Suite | Tests | Status |
|---|---|---|
| run_quick.sh | 9 | ✓ |
| test_sdk.sh | 11 | ✓ |
| test_audit.sh | 10 | ✓ |
| test_dedup_props.sh | 12 | ✓ |
| test_path_traversal.sh | 5 | ✓ NEW |
| **zupt total** | **47** | **✓** |
| Format mutation fuzz (ASAN/UBSAN) | 1,000 iters | ✓ |
| Inherited libzuptsdk audit | 42 | ✓ |
| Inherited libzuptsdk RFC + roundtrip | 84 | ✓ |
| Inherited libzuptsdk binding contracts | 57 | ✓ |
| Inherited libzuptsdk Wycheproof | 5 | ✓ |
| Inherited libzuptsdk fuzz | 750,000 iters | ✓ |
| **Combined zupt + SDK** | **265 tests + 751k fuzz** | **✓** |

### Portability re-verification

Static portability scan: clean.
- No unaligned pointer casts
- No raw `/` separators (uses `ZUPT_PATH_SEP`)
- No `htonl`/`ntohl`/struct casts (LE helpers throughout)
- No POSIX-only headers without `#ifdef _WIN32` guards

GCC + `-Wpedantic` build: clean.
Win32 paths verified via `-D_WIN32 -E` synthetic preprocessing.

### Cumulative bug count across audit sprints

| Sprint | Bugs found | Severity range |
|---|---|---|
| v2.2.1 (first audit) | 6 | low to high |
| v2.2.2 (second audit) | 4 | low to medium |
| v2.2.2 formal | 4 | low to **high** (Zip Slip path traversal) |
| v2.2.2 sprint 4 | 1 | **critical** (silent extract via arg parser) |
| v2.2.2 god-tier audit | 1 | **critical** (block-swap AEAD) |
| **Total** | **16** | **all fixed and regression-tested** |

### Open items

- External independent audit still pending (cost, not engineering)
- Side-channel timing leak testing not performed
- Cross-OS CI (macOS / Windows / FreeBSD runners) not yet wired
- Formal verification beyond Jasmin constant-time primitives (F*, ProVerif)
  not pursued



## 2026-05-01 — v2.2.3 release audit (VaptVupt 2.48.2 integration)

Two independent test passes performed: one on the working tree, a
second on a clean build from the produced source tarball
(`zupt-2.2.3-source.tar.gz`). Both passes identical and clean.

### Surfaces verified

| Surface | Test target | Pass 1 | Pass 2 | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| Quick suite | `make test` | 9 + 11 + 10 + 12 + 5 + 8 + 6 = 61 OK | 61 OK | All `tests/*.sh` |
| Regression | `tests/regression.sh` | 22/22 | 22/22 | T17 fixed (see CHANGELOG) |
| Threaded | `tests/test_threaded.sh` | 14/14 | 14/14 | MT compress/decompress |
| Post-quantum | `tests/test_pq.sh` | 10/10 | 10/10 | `--pq-sdk` and legacy `--pq` |
| VaptVupt unit | `make test-vv` | 11/11 | 11/11 | All modes + format_v2 |
| NIST vectors | `make test-vectors` | 13/13 | 13/13 | XXH64, SHA-256, ML-KEM, X25519, AES, HMAC |
| ASAN/UBSan | `make test-asan` | clean | clean | plain + password + `--pq-sdk`; levels 1, 5, 9 |
| Format mutation fuzz | `make fuzz-format-run` | 1000 iters, 0 crashes | 1000 iters, 0 crashes | ASAN-instrumented binary as victim |
| License audit | `make audit-licenses` | clean | clean | All SPDX correct (AGPL for Zupt, GPL for VaptVupt) |
| GCC strict warnings | `-Wall -Wextra -Wpedantic` | 0 | 0 | C11 strict |
| Disk backup | `zupt disk backup`/`restore` | byte-exact sha256 | — | 5 MB image, all PATTERN markers preserved |

Cumulative cases passing: **112 across 12 suites**, both passes.

### Defect found and fixed in this release cycle

VaptVupt 2.48.2 + `format_v2 = 1` + `VV_MODE_ULTRA_FAST` produces
output the decoder rejects with `VV_ERR_OVERFLOW`. The combination
is **not in VaptVupt's upstream test matrix**
(`vaptvupt-2.48.2/tests/test_zupt_integration.c` exercises
`format_v2` only with `BALANCED` and `EXTREME`). Caught by Zupt's own
`tests/regression.sh` T17 (VaptVupt all levels) before release.

Workaround in `src/vaptvupt_api.c`: set `opts.format_v2 = 0` for
levels 1–2 (`VV_MODE_ULTRA_FAST`); leave `format_v2 = 1` for levels
3–9. To be reported upstream; once VaptVupt validates the combination
the guard can be lifted.

### Defect found and fixed in this release cycle (build system)

The `STALE_OBJS` arch-safety guard in `Makefile` was comparing the
canonical strings `x86-64` (from `file(1)`) against `x86_64` (from
`$(CC) -dumpmachine`) and treating them as different architectures,
causing every `make` invocation to wipe and rebuild every `.o` file
even on a consistent host. Both sides are now normalised through
`tr -d '_-' | tr [:upper:] [:lower:]` so the comparison succeeds on a
same-arch tree and only fires when the tarball really did include
cross-arch objects.

### Packages produced and verified

All built from the same source tree, then exercised end-to-end
(encrypted compress + extract + sha256 byte-compare) outside the build
host's normal library search path:
