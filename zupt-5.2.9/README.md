# ZUPT 5.2.9

[English](README.md) | [Português do Brasil](README.pt-BR.md)

ZUPT is a command-line backup archiver written in C11. It combines the
bundled VaptVupt compression codec with authenticated AES-256-CTR +
HMAC-SHA256 encryption, native ML-KEM-768/X25519 hybrid encryption, archive
integrity checks, multithreaded operation, and a Python/Qt graphical frontend.

Version 5.2.9 updates the bundled VaptVupt codec from 2.65.3 to 2.65.11.
The refresh carries decoder span validation, stricter truncated-bitstream and
output-capacity handling, allocation reuse, scalar-build support, and XXH64
pointer-bound corrections while retaining Zupt's wrapper policy and read-back
self-check. Archive format 1.6, codec identifier `0x0010`, CLI behavior, and SDK
ABI remain unchanged. Publish a release only after its exact-tag source,
package, sanitizer, Windows, and macOS matrix passes.

Version 5.2.8 closes three CodeQL High path-race findings: SDK key copies now
publish atomically through an already-open private object, POSIX disk restore
classifies and retains the descriptor it actually opened, and benchmark cleanup
traverses only pinned descriptors or handles without following links or Windows
reparse points. It also makes the raw-C1 scanner fixture explicitly skip a
filesystem that rejects creation with `EILSEQ`, normalizes Bash 3.2 signed-byte
diagnostics, and brings `sdk-test` into the
release and hosted Linux gates. Windows password prompts now reject redirected
input before entering `_getch` and treat console EOF as an error; its key-file
regression validates the protected current-user-only DACL rather than an MSYS
POSIX-mode projection. The C/C++ default-branch scan run `33452563116` of
commit `7a8e5c5` completed successfully after the follow-up changed the new SDK
regression to no-follow descriptors plus `fstat` and descriptor reads. Alerts
#5 through #10 are fixed, and the authenticated code-scanning API reported zero
open alerts. Final release-commit CodeQL run `33456049125` also completed
successfully, with the API still reporting zero open alerts. These corrections
do not change archive format v1.6,
cryptography, the bundled codec release, or the SDK ABI.

The predecessor `v5.2.7` tag is immutable and was not promoted. Exact-tag run
`33445470664` concluded `cancelled` at `2026-08-31T23:11:19Z`, with 13
successful jobs, a macOS raw-C1/EILSEQ fixture failure, and a cancelled Windows
job. The hosted Windows job stalled in `make check`; a MinGW/Wine reproduction
attributed the stall to a non-console password prompt entering `_getch`. No
v5.2.7 evidence transfers automatically to v5.2.8.

Manual pre-tag run `33452602634` then completed 14 of 15 jobs successfully at
`7a8e5c5`, including the native macOS DMG gate and the Windows build and full
distribution checks. Its Windows smoke test failed only when the old MSYS
`grep` matched a literal non-BMP filename after the product had already
compressed and verified all five files. MinGW/Wine reproduction confirmed the
exact `F0 9F 98 80` UTF-8 bytes in ZUPT's redirected listing. The corrected
gate creates that name from byte escapes, validates Latin-1, BMP, and non-BMP
listing bytes with Python, and requires extraction plus a full tree diff. The
failed run is diagnostic evidence, not release-candidate approval.

The immutable `v5.2.8` candidate at commit
`ebb9ab3aa1d42c50030ca02883f6162dc4771fe1` subsequently passed all 15 jobs in
manually dispatched exact-tag run `33456209269`. That run includes the pinned
local OBS source-service chain, reproducible source checks, GCC/Clang, analyzers,
sanitizers, DEB/RPM/SRPM and portable-package gates, the native Windows ZIP
round trip, and the mounted macOS arm64 DMG test. Corrected promotion run
`33457868306` validated and published exactly 13 assets. The canonical source
archive is 798296 bytes with SHA-256
`378b9506211545b9594cf0d38ac8955d9b1cac34eb6b379ae0ec26b84edb65f7`.

Version 5.2.2 restored the original ZUPT product name and the `zupt` command.
The `.zupt` archive extension, format v1.6, magic bytes, codec identifiers, and
SDK ABI remain unchanged. An optional `vaptvupt` command alias may be provided
for scripts written against versions 3.0.0 through 5.2.1.

## Codec compatibility refresh in 5.2.9

The in-tree codec corresponds to VaptVupt tag `v2.65.11` at commit
`1cc78bce90619dbf97e0ed1ad449c3c4f6329041`. Zupt keeps its established
level-to-mode mapping, codec-checksum-off policy, automatic window and BCJ
selection, and decode-plus-compare acceptance check. Zupt records its own
per-block XXH64; encrypted modes additionally authenticate ciphertext and
metadata with HMAC-SHA256. It continues
to use independent one-shot frames and does not require a kernel module or the
new caller-owned FAST context. Focused cross-version fixtures are supporting
local evidence, not a substitute for the complete 5.2.9 release matrix.

Brazilian Portuguese introductions and operational guidance are provided in
[README.pt-BR.md](README.pt-BR.md) and
[DOCUMENTACAO.pt-BR.md](DOCUMENTACAO.pt-BR.md).

## Corrective changes introduced in 5.2.8

SDK key saves use atomic descriptor/handle-backed publication and preserve the
requested private/public modes without reopening the destination. Disk restore
opens a POSIX target once before its type, identity, and device-capacity
decisions, and benchmark cleanup is descriptor-relative on POSIX and
handle/reparse-point aware on Windows. The live-workspace symlink regression,
SDK link-target/mode regression, static path-race guards, portable raw-C1
fixture with Bash 3.2 unsigned-byte normalization, native redirected-prompt
and protected-DACL regressions, byte-exact BMP/non-BMP Windows list and extract
checks, and `sdk-test` CI step cover these boundaries. All current release
paths moved to 5.2.8 and received fresh exact-tag hosted CI, package,
native-platform, source-only, checksum, OBS, and promotion evidence in runs
`33456209269` and `33457868306`.

## Corrective changes introduced in 5.2.7

The SHA-NI regression keeps x86-only helper declarations out of unsupported
arm64 builds, and the safe UTF-8 Windows fixture crosses the argv boundary in a
byte-stable representation. Those test-harness changes did not alter the
archive format, cryptography, codec, or SDK ABI. Exact-tag run `33445470664`
subsequently exposed the separate macOS raw-C1/EILSEQ fixture failure; Windows
was cancelled after the hosted job stalled in `make check`; MinGW/Wine then
isolated the stall to a non-console password prompt entering `_getch`. The run recorded 13 successful jobs, one
failure, and one cancellation; v5.2.7 remained unpromoted.

## Corrective changes introduced in 5.2.6

Darwin and NetBSD select the portable compiler-resistant secure-wipe fallback;
scanner option/path arrays are guarded for Bash 3.2; and hostile Windows path
fixtures use explicit bytes and reject dangerous raw diagnostic fragments.
Those corrections changed release/test integration only. The resulting v5.2.6
candidate was not promoted because its next exact-tag run exposed the distinct
arm64 SHA-NI helper and safe UTF-8 Windows argv failures described above.

## Corrective changes introduced in 5.2.5

The exact-tag openSUSE gate executes its standalone service chain from the
directory containing `_service`. A local Tumbleweed reproduction confirmed
that `refs/tags/v5.2.4` resolves correctly and that entering the service
directory completes `obs_scm`, `tar`, and `recompress`. The immutable v5.2.4
candidate recorded 12 successful jobs in run `33431386002`; its openSUSE job
failed before the correction and dependent Windows/macOS jobs were skipped.

## Corrective changes introduced in 5.2.4

The release gate now validates the required CRLF checkout form without treating
it as source drift. That candidate required fresh exact-tag CI, package,
native-platform, source-only, and checksum evidence before promotion. The
`v5.2.3` tag remains immutable and unpromoted.

## Corrective changes introduced in 5.2.3

The corrective release carries the 5.2.2 security and format work forward
without a new archive format, codec, or SDK ABI. It realigns every current
version-bearing package and release path to 5.2.3, stabilizes the GUI version
contract used by package gates, and repairs native RPM container setup for
Tumbleweed and Fedora. A fresh exact-tag CI, package, native-platform,
source-only, and checksum record is required before any asset is promoted. See
[CHANGELOG.md](CHANGELOG.md) for the release record.

## Security and source baseline introduced in 5.2.2

This patch release makes the upstream and distribution path auditable from
source and tightens archive integrity handling:

- removed incomplete vendored SDK/PQBOX header snapshots and every fallback to
  local precompiled libraries;
- made WITH_SDK and WITH_PQBOX opt-in system integrations with explicit failure
  when their development dependencies are unavailable;
- removed build-tree RPATH/RUNPATH injection and architecture-wide AVX2 flags;
- made compiler target detection, packager flags, staged installation and
  cleanup portable;
- hardened extraction against traversal components, symlinks, hardlinks,
  Windows reparse points, and pre-existing output files; verified data is
  published from a private temporary file only after size and checksum checks;
- made normal, solid, and disk-image compression publish archives atomically
  without opening a symlink or hardlink target at the requested leaf; POSIX
  canonicalizes a user-selected parent once and then pins its physical
  directory, while Windows rejects reparse-point parents; compression also
  rejects an output that resolves to the input itself, including alternate
  path spellings, hardlinks, and symlinks, even when `--force` is used;
- made disk restore validate and consume one private snapshot of the input
  archive before opening its destructive destination; raw-device capacity is
  queried before the first write and an unknown or undersized target fails
  closed;
- require both XXH64 and an independent SHA-256/128 digest match in the writer
  before a block is replaced with a deduplication reference;
- bind every encrypted data or dedup-reference frame to its logical position;
  an authenticated reference also carries the position needed to authenticate
  the original data frame, so neither a data frame nor an otherwise equivalent
  reference can be moved silently;
- require an archive-integrity trailer (AIT) for every validating content-read
  path by default, without trusting unauthenticated header flags; the explicit
  legacy override is only for a known, trusted archive created before AIT
  existed;
- authenticate reference offsets in new encrypted+dedup archives, and bind the
  encrypted disk index to its archive metadata;
- store and verify a chained whole-image content hash in new disk archives;
  this XXH64 value detects corruption but is not a cryptographic authenticator
  in an unencrypted archive;
- serialize fixed-width format values explicitly as little-endian and reject
  non-canonical or overflowing uint64 varints;
- reject unexpected frame types wherever decoded DATA is required, including
  multithreaded, serial, solid, test, and disk-image readers;
- retain narrow reader paths for the fixed-width disk index and encrypted
  deduplication AAD sequence published by 5.2.1; an actual password-encrypted
  DATA/DATA/REF/DATA disk fixture is tested byte-exact without claiming that older
  readers accept the new 5.2.2 records;
- use a randomly created private directory for benchmark scratch files and
  remove it without following links, instead of deriving a writable path only
  from the process ID;
- added a reusable source-only scanner, adversarial scanner tests and CI gates;
- added current openSUSE/OBS packaging under packaging/opensuse;
- restored ZUPT/`zupt` as the product, command, package, GUI, documentation,
  and release-artifact identity without changing the archive or SDK formats;
- added explicit `--password-prompt`, `--pass-file`, and `--pass-fd` inputs so a
  password need not be placed in process arguments;
- create native private-key files without replacement using POSIX mode `0600`
  or a Windows current-user-only DACL, and strictly validate ZKEY/ZPQK checksum,
  version, flags, reserved bytes, exact size, and public/private role before use;
- restore POSIX terminal state after handled password-prompt interruptions and
  render archive comments without emitting raw terminal-control sequences;
- make the regression interpreter explicitly Bash and add bounded nested-
  archive resource handling to the source-only scanner;
- documented the bundled codec, GUI data assets and all applicable license scopes;
- added gated, source-built release-package workflows without committing
  package artifacts or compiled code to Git.

See [CHANGELOG.md](CHANGELOG.md) for the release record.

## Canonical source

- Canonical: https://github.com/cristiancmoises/zupt
- Codeberg mirror: https://codeberg.org/berkeley/zupt
- SecurityOps Brazil mirror: https://git.securityops.com.br/cristiancmoises/zupt
- SecurityOps global mirror: https://git.securityops.co/cristiancmoises/zupt

GitHub remains canonical. For every published version, the 13 gated assets
must be mirrored byte-for-byte on the three hosts above after exact-tag gates
and promotion succeed.

## Source-only policy

Tracked Git state and source archives contain source/build/packaging files,
documentation, tests, and necessary non-executable data only. They do not
contain object files, shared or static libraries, compiled executables,
RPM/DEB/AppImage packages, unresolved Git LFS pointers, or release binaries.

Release pages may provide separately generated packages requested for end
users. Those assets must be built from the tagged source, tested on their target
environment, and kept outside Git and the source archive. A format that was not
built and tested is not presented as supported.

## 5.2.9 release artifact contract

The 5.2.9 release may contain exactly the following 13 files only after every
corresponding target gate succeeds. `SHA256SUMS` must record the exact promoted
filenames and digests. Release notes must identify the tested commit and the
manually dispatched exact-tag CI run. Until then, an asset is unpublished.

| Format | Intended target and validation boundary |
| --- | --- |
| `zupt-5.2.9.tar.gz` | Reproducible, source-only archive; scanned twice-built input plus SHA-256. |
| `zupt-5.2.9.tar.gz.sha256` | SHA-256 sidecar for the reproducible source archive. |
| `zupt_5.2.9_amd64.deb` | Ubuntu 24.04 amd64 package; install, functional round trip, and uninstall gate. |
| `zupt-5.2.9-0.x86_64.rpm` | openSUSE Tumbleweed x86_64 binary RPM; package inspection, install, round trip, and uninstall gate. |
| `zupt-5.2.9-0.src.rpm` | Source RPM corresponding exactly to the gated openSUSE binary RPM. |
| `zupt-5.2.9-linux-x86_64.tar.xz` | Linux x86_64 CLI plus the complete public license/notice payload; dependency allowlist and extracted-package functional gate. |
| `zupt-gui_5.2.9_all.deb` | Architecture-independent Python/Qt GUI package; exact dependency/payload checks plus installed off-screen GUI/CLI integration gate. |
| `zupt-gui-5.2.9-1.noarch.rpm` | Architecture-independent Python/Qt GUI RPM; package inspection plus installed off-screen GUI/CLI integration gate. |
| `zupt-gui-5.2.9-1.src.rpm` | Source RPM corresponding exactly to the gated noarch GUI RPM. |
| `zupt-gui-5.2.9-portable.zip` | Source-only GUI and launchers with licenses/provenance; source scan, exact member allowlist, and extracted off-screen GUI/CLI gate. |
| `zupt-5.2.9-windows-x86_64.zip` | Native Windows x86_64 executable with notices; extracted-ZIP round-trip gate. |
| Exactly one `ZUPT-5.2.9-macOS-{x86_64\|arm64}.dmg` | Native macOS image; mounted packaged executable round-trip gate, with the actual runner architecture in the filename. |
| `SHA256SUMS` | Deterministic manifest covering the other 12 promoted files. |

An asset absent from the release was not promoted through its mandatory gate.
Do not infer support for another distribution release, OS version, CPU
architecture, raw UNC/SMB destination, or package manager from a similarly
named file. Binary assets are release outputs, never source-build inputs.

No AppImage is promised for 5.2.9. The inspected upstream type-2 runtime lacked
a complete notice/source-relink handoff for every statically linked component,
so redistributing it would not meet this release's provenance gate. AppDir and
Flatpak bundles and GUI platform installers are likewise outside the promoted
set because their runtime, license, or target gates are incomplete. A bare
Linux executable or Windows `.exe` is not promoted: each CLI executable is
carried only inside its notice-bearing archive. The Windows ZIP and macOS DMG
remain CLI-only.

The promoted GUI artifacts are the gated architecture-independent DEB,
noarch/source RPM, and source-only portable ZIP listed above. The portable ZIP
does not bundle Python, Qt, or the ZUPT CLI; its launchers select compatible
software already installed on the target. Other historical GUI packages and
platform installers are not carried forward implicitly.

The canonical source repository is
<https://github.com/cristiancmoises/zupt>. After promotion, the canonical
release URL is <https://github.com/cristiancmoises/zupt/releases/tag/v5.2.9>.
Assets referenced
by the AUR, Homebrew, Guix, or generic RPM recipes must exist there at their
recorded URL before those recipes are published.

Audit the current checkout and its Git archive with:

~~~sh
bash scripts/check-source-only.sh
bash tests/test_source_only.sh
~~~

For a tag or an existing source archive:

~~~sh
bash scripts/check-source-only.sh --tag v5.2.9
bash scripts/check-source-only.sh --archive /path/to/zupt-5.2.9.tar.gz
~~~

Unknown `.bin` files fail the scan. A necessary binary data fixture may be
allowed only with `--data-manifest FILE`; each tab-separated record must name
its path, purpose, provenance, and SPDX license. This exception never permits
compiled or executable magic, packages, AppImages, bytecode, or Git LFS
pointers. Nested scans cap recursion, member count, individual expansion, and
total expanded bytes and fail closed at a limit. On committed Linux candidate
`ff99770`, all 39 source-only scanner cases passed, including GNU thin archives,
scanner-bomb limits, and safe diagnostic cases.

## Build from source

Required for the default build:

- a C11 compiler;
- GNU make;
- the system C, math and threading libraries.

Git, tar and gzip are needed for source-archive generation. Bash and Python 3
are used by the complete test suite. No build target downloads dependencies.

Build the distribution configuration:

~~~sh
make clean
make -j"$(getconf _NPROCESSORS_ONLN 2>/dev/null || echo 1)" \
    WITH_SDK=0 WITH_PQBOX=0 V=1
make WITH_SDK=0 WITH_PQBOX=0 check
~~~

The Makefile honors CC, CPPFLAGS, CFLAGS, LDFLAGS, LDLIBS, AR, RANLIB,
STRIP, DESTDIR, PREFIX, BINDIR, LIBDIR, INCLUDEDIR and MANDIR. Project include
paths are added separately and do not replace distribution optimization or
hardening flags.

The default x86 build targets the architecture ABI baseline. SHA-NI is compiled
in its own translation unit and runtime-gated. AVX2 is not enabled across whole
codec translation units. Textual assembly under `jasmin/` can be requested with
WITH_JASMIN=1 on a compatible x86_64 compiler target; it includes generated
Jasmin output and separately identified hand-written assembly. The portable C
fallback is the default.

## Optional SDK and PQBOX integrations

Both optional integrations are off by default and never load a library from the
repository:

| Option | Enables | Dependency behavior |
| --- | --- | --- |
| WITH_SDK=1 | --pq-sdk and the SDK-backed Argon2id path | Uses the system libvuptsdk development package through pkg-config. |
| WITH_PQBOX=1 | --pq-box | Uses the system libpqvaptvupt development package through pkg-config. |

If a system package has no pkg-config file, an administrator may supply
SDK_CPPFLAGS and SDK_LDLIBS, or PQBOX_CPPFLAGS and PQBOX_LDLIBS, explicitly.
Enabling an option without usable system link flags stops at Makefile parsing
with an actionable error. There is no download, vendored binary fallback or
automatic RPATH.

The default source-only build retains password encryption through
PBKDF2-SHA256, native hybrid encryption through --pq, and ML-KEM-only encryption
through --pq-only. It reports SDK/PQBOX-only operations as unavailable rather
than silently changing modes.

## Install and uninstall

For a normal local installation:

~~~sh
sudo make install
~~~

The upstream default prefix is `/usr/local`. Use a staged `PREFIX=/usr`
installation for packaging rather than writing directly into `/usr` as an
unprivileged user.

For packaging or inspection:

~~~sh
stage=$(mktemp -d)
make install DESTDIR="$stage" PREFIX=/usr INSTALL_LEGACY_ALIAS=0
find "$stage" -print
~~~

`INSTALL_LEGACY_ALIAS=1` explicitly adds the renamed-era compatibility command
and manual page named `vaptvupt`. The default is 0. Distribution packages
should keep it at 0 unless they have verified ownership and conflicts for that
compatibility name.
The openSUSE package installs `zupt` as the primary command.

Uninstall uses the same path variables:

~~~sh
sudo make uninstall PREFIX=/usr/local INSTALL_LEGACY_ALIAS=0
~~~

## Tests

The principal source-only gates are:

~~~sh
make WITH_SDK=0 WITH_PQBOX=0 check
make WITH_SDK=0 WITH_PQBOX=0 test-all
make sdk-test
make test-asan
make test-asan-run
make audit-licenses
bash tests/test_source_only.sh
bash scripts/test-installed-zupt.sh ./zupt
~~~

The installed/functional test covers text, random and empty files, nested
directories, spaces and UTF-8 names, archive verification, extraction and
SHA-256 comparison, wrong-password rejection, corrupt-archive rejection,
destination-symlink escape protection, atomic archive-output replacement,
--help, --version and invalid options.

`disk restore` first copies the measured archive into a private, auto-deleted
scratch file, validates that snapshot, and restores from the same open stream.
Set `ZUPT_TMPDIR` to an existing private scratch directory when the default
temporary filesystem lacks space; it must hold at least the compacted archive
size. An invalid override fails without falling back elsewhere or opening the
destination. Regular-file destinations retain atomic publication; raw block
devices are accepted only when their capacity can be determined and is large
enough. The privileged undersized-loop-device regression is reported `SKIP`,
not `PASS`, when the environment cannot create a loop device.

The immutable, non-promoted 5.2.2 candidate at commit `ff99770` passed the local
`make release-check`. Recorded results include packaging
`PASS=49 FAIL=0 SKIP=0`, the 39/39 source-only scanner suite, strict GCC and
Clang, GCC `-fanalyzer`, a 9/9 full tool-enabled static-analysis run,
ASan/UBSan/LSan, and 1,000 mutation-fuzz iterations without a
sanitizer-detected crash. An earlier off-screen GUI smoke run remains supporting
evidence rather than an exact-candidate package result.

Those results are historical upstream self-audit evidence, not independent
certification and not 5.2.8 results. Post-tag CI integration failures prevented
5.2.2 promotion. The immutable 5.2.3 candidate was also not promoted because its
source-policy test assumed LF for a `.bat` checkout that correctly used CRLF.
The immutable v5.2.4 candidate then recorded 12 successful jobs in exact-tag CI
run `33431386002`; the sole openSUSE service-harness job failed because the
standalone executor did not enter its service directory, so dependent Windows
and macOS jobs were skipped. A local Tumbleweed reproduction proved the explicit
tag ref and corrected working-directory contract, but neither that reproduction
nor the successful v5.2.4 jobs are v5.2.8 evidence. The immutable v5.2.5
candidate was not promoted after exact-tag GitHub Actions run `33434986357`:
13 jobs succeeded, but the native Windows hostile-path fixture and macOS
build/check gate failed. Their 5.2.6 corrections were followed by exact-tag run
`33442264243`, which also completed 13 jobs successfully but failed native
macOS on arm64-unused SHA-NI helper declarations under `-Werror` and native
Windows during safe UTF-8 fixture argv transcoding. The immutable v5.2.6 tag was
not promoted. The immutable v5.2.7 tag was also not promoted: exact-tag run
`33445470664` reached the macOS raw-C1 filename-creation failure with `EILSEQ`,
recorded 13 successful jobs, and cancelled Windows after the hosted job stalled
in `make check`; a MinGW/Wine reproduction isolated the stall to
`test --password-prompt ... </dev/null` entering `_getch`. The
exact 5.2.8 candidate then repeated all required gates: exact-tag run
`33456209269` completed 15/15 jobs successfully, including native Windows and
macOS, the pinned local OBS service chain, source/package gates, and the
openSUSE RPM checks. Promotion run `33457868306` published the exact tested
asset allowlist. Unexecuted environments remain `SKIP`, never `PASS`; these
project-run results are not independent certification.

On Windows, 5.2.9 scopes output handling to normal local Win32 paths. A MinGW
cross-build or Wine run is not native-Windows evidence; the `windows-latest`
package job, including its Unicode round trip, remains a mandatory publication
gate. Win32 extended-length and device-namespace paths, raw UNC output roots
such as `\\server\share`, and mapped/network-drive output are not supported in
this version. Restore to a normal local path first.

Tests for WITH_SDK=1 or WITH_PQBOX=1 are optional-dependency tests. A missing
system library is reported as SKIP and is never counted as a PASS for that
feature.

## Trusted legacy archives without AIT

`extract`, `list`, `test`, and `disk restore` require a valid
archive-integrity trailer by default, without trusting header flags to decide
whether authentication is required. This prevents an attacker from silently
removing the trailer, clearing an unauthenticated encryption flag, and
downgrading authentication of header and footer metadata.
`--allow-legacy-no-ait` is accepted only by `extract`, `list`, `test`, and
`disk restore`, and exists only to recover a known, trusted archive created
before AIT was introduced. Do not use that override for an archive from
untrusted or attacker-writable storage; verify and migrate the recovered data to
a newly created 5.2.9 archive. Compression and disk backup never create a
no-AIT archive.

`info` is deliberately different: it reports unauthenticated framing metadata,
including whether a trailer appears to be present, without validating the AIT
or archive contents. Its success is not an integrity result and must not be used
to decide that an untrusted archive is safe.

This no-AIT exception is distinct from the v5.2.1 disk-index compatibility
path. Published v5.2.1 disk archives normally have an AIT; the narrow
compatibility scope includes an actual v5.2.1 password-encrypted, deduplicated
disk archive with a DATA/DATA/REF/DATA sequence using the fixed-width legacy index
and the legacy linear AAD sequence. The repository stores that 718-byte archive
as auditable hexadecimal text with its provenance and SHA-256; the candidate
lists, tests, extracts, and restores it byte-exact. The full local Linux gate
passed on commit `ff99770`. This is not a claim that a 5.2.1 reader understands every new
flag-gated 5.2.2 encoding or that every historical combination was tested.

The build/audit commands and recorded 5.2.8 outcomes are maintained in the
release evidence and
[packaging/opensuse/README.md](packaging/opensuse/README.md). No architecture or
distribution is claimed merely because the code has a fallback path.

## Source archive

Generate the reproducible source archive outside the repository:

~~~sh
make dist
sha256sum /tmp/zupt-5.2.9.tar.gz
bash scripts/check-source-only.sh \
    --archive /tmp/zupt-5.2.9.tar.gz
~~~

Archive ordering, ownership and timestamps are normalized. The default epoch is
recorded in `.source-date-epoch`; a packager may override SOURCE_DATE_EPOCH.
Running the export twice from identical committed input and epoch must produce
the same SHA-256. The AUR, Homebrew and Guix recipes are `export-ignore` so
their checksum fields do not make the archive self-referential. `make dist`
archives the verified `HEAD` tree object rather than embedding the commit ID,
so a commit changing only those ignored recipes leaves the fixed-epoch archive
byte-identical. A tagged release must contain the final archive digest/content
hash in each export-ignored recipe, contain no `REPLACE_AFTER...` marker, and
pass the package syntax gate.

## openSUSE and OBS

The maintained upstream recipe is in packaging/opensuse. It targets the
immutable v5.2.9 tag, disables submodules and Git LFS, builds with
WITH_SDK=0 WITH_PQBOX=0, runs real checks, and installs without the renamed-era
`vaptvupt` alias.

This repository does not claim that the package has been submitted to or
accepted by openSUSE Factory. The packaging README distinguishes local parsing,
container/RPM builds, OBS operations and architectures that were not executed.

## Bundled codec provenance

The bundled compression codec is source from VaptVupt tag `v2.65.11` at commit
`1cc78bce90619dbf97e0ed1ad449c3c4f6329041`. The repository preserves local
wrapper, safety, platform, and provenance adjustments; details are in
[THIRD-PARTY-NOTICES.md](THIRD-PARTY-NOTICES.md).

The package declares `bundled(vaptvupt-codec) = 2.65.11`. It does not claim that
the codec is unbundled or provided by a system library.

## Security notes

- Keep passwords and private keys out of command histories where possible. Use
  `--password-prompt`, `--pass-file` with restrictive permissions, or an
  inherited descriptor through `--pass-fd`; `-p/--password` exposes its next
  argument to process inspection.
- Native private-key generation refuses an existing destination and uses POSIX
  mode `0600` or a Windows current-user-only DACL. A failed write/flush/close
  leaves its incomplete or durability-uncertain exclusive file for manual
  review and removal instead of unlinking a possibly replaced pathname.
  ZKEY/ZPQK inputs with a bad
  checksum, version, flags, reserved bytes, length, or role are rejected.
- Compression does not protect a compromised endpoint or weak credentials.
- Archive metadata and total size can still reveal information.
- Treat unexpected authentication, format or integrity errors as failures; do
  not discard the original input until a restored copy has been verified.
- Report vulnerabilities according to [SECURITY.md](SECURITY.md).

## GUI

The optional GUI is under `gui/`. It invokes the `zupt` CLI and needs Python 3
plus PySide6 or PyQt6. GUI image assets are data files whose purpose,
provenance and license are recorded in [gui/assets/README.md](gui/assets/README.md).
The integrated source and lightweight consistency checks do not constitute a
target-native audit of every historical GUI format. The 5.2.9 artifact promise
is limited to the gated GUI DEB, noarch/source RPM, and source-only portable ZIP
listed above; AppImage, AppDir, Flatpak bundles, and platform GUI installers
remain excluded.

## Maintainers and openSUSE credit

Cristian Cezar Moisés is the creator and current upstream maintainer of ZUPT and
the author of the current upstream source, build, test, documentation, and
packaging changes, including the 5.2.2 baseline and corrective
5.2.3/5.2.4/5.2.5/5.2.6/5.2.7/5.2.8/5.2.9 work.

Alessandro de Oliveira Faria (Cabelo) is credited as the openSUSE collaborator
and downstream package maintainer. He reviews the handoff, commits it in the
OBS project he maintains, and may make the additional openSUSE-side adjustments
he considers necessary. That downstream role is not attribution of ZUPT source
authorship or of the upstream 5.2.2, 5.2.3, 5.2.4, 5.2.5, 5.2.6, 5.2.7, or
5.2.8 or 5.2.9 changes.
